Game-Dev Project

Follow our protagonist, Hiro, as he struggles against the darkness of the cavern and the darkness within. Escape the gloomy cave and face many different enemies and obstacles in this somber dungeon-crawler. Hear the vibrant music mixed with the sounds of the rain. This game is not a happy one. (But I hope you find the secret "hope" ending!)
